## CTF (Capture The Flag)

I have been playing CTFs as a member of an university team [TSG](https://ctftime.org/team/16088) whose team members are all from The University of Tokyo.
Sometimes, I join in larger teams to compete large contests like DEFCON.

I list some of my achievements in CTF contests below. Note that due to the collaborative nature of CTFs, my individual contribution varied from one CTF to another :)

- As a member of TSG
  - SECCON 2022: [International Finalists](https://ctftime.org/event/1864/)
  - CTFZone 2020: [Finalists](https://ctftime.org/event/967)
  - TokyoWesterns CTF 2020: [9th](https://ctftime.org/event/1086)
  - Codeblue CTF 2018: [Finalists](https://ctftime.org/event/670)
  - SECCON 2018 International Finals: [Winner](https://2018.seccon.jp/2019/01/final-result-of-seccon-ctf-2018.html)
- As a member of other teams
  - DEFCON CTF 2023: [finalists](https://ctftime.org/event/2078/) as a member of `undef1ned`
  - DEFCON CTF 2022: [finalists](https://ctftime.org/event/1662/) as a member of `./V /home/r/.bin/tw`
  - Google CTF 2020(hackceler8): [finalists](https://capturetheflag.withgoogle.com/hackceler8#matches) as a member of `I use bing`

### My CTF Challenges

I have created a lot of CTF challenges so far from easy one to harder one: please refer to this page(TBD)
