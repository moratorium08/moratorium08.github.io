## CTF (Capture The Flag)

I have been playing CTFs as a member of an university team [TSG](https://ctftime.org/team/16088) whose team members are all from The University of Tokyo.
Sometimes, I join in larger teams to compete large contests like DEFCON. I mainly play pwnable (binary exploit) and reversing.

Here are some of my achievements in CTF contests. Note that due to the collaborative nature of CTFs, my individual contribution varied from one CTF to another :)

- As a member of TSG
  - SECCON 2022: [International Finalists](https://ctftime.org/event/1864/)
  - CTFZone 2020: [Finalists](https://ctftime.org/event/967)
  - TokyoWesterns CTF 2020: [9th](https://ctftime.org/event/1086)
  - Codeblue CTF 2018: [Finalists](https://ctftime.org/event/670)
  - SECCON 2018 International Finals: [Winner](https://2018.seccon.jp/2019/01/final-result-of-seccon-ctf-2018.html)
- As a member of other teams
  - SECCON CTF Domestic Finals 2023: [winner](https://ctftime.org/event/2160) as a member of `:)`
  - DEFCON CTF 2023: [finalists](https://ctftime.org/event/2078/) as a member of `undef1ned`
  - DEFCON CTF 2022: [finalists](https://ctftime.org/event/1662/) as a member of `./V /home/r/.bin/tw`
  - Google CTF 2020(hackceler8): [finalists](https://capturetheflag.withgoogle.com/hackceler8#matches) as a member of `I use bing`
