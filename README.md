## CTF (Capture The Flag)

I have been playing CTFs as a member of an university team [TSG](https://ctftime.org/team/16088) whose team members are all from The University of Tokyo.
Sometimes, I join in larger teams to compete large contests like DEFCON.


I list my achievements in CTF contests below. However, please note that due to the collaborative nature of CTFs, my individual contribution varied from one CTF to another :)
